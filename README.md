**2025 Spring CSCI1470 Deep Learning Final Project**

**Authors: [Haosheng Wang](https://github.com/Wonder947), Edrick Guerrero, [Alfonso Gordon Cabello de los Cobos](https://github.com/AlfonsoR-GordonCC)**
## Summary
The idea of this project is to implement Modern Hopfield Networks on the CIFAR10 dataset for classification of the different elements inside the set. This will be done by using TensorFlow as a way of providing another alternative than PyTorch, wich is theone used originally in [Hopfield Networks is All You Need](https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers) by [Institute for Machine Learning, Johannes Kepler University Linz](https://github.com/ml-jku)

### Introduction
Memory involves the efficient storage and retrieval of information, and it comes in various forms—short-term, long-term, sensory, procedural, among others. Hopfield networks, also known as associative memories, are a class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) designed to function as content-addressable memory systems. A defining characteristic of these networks is their ability to reconstruct entire patterns from partial or noisy inputs.

The original Hopfield network, introduced by John J. Hopfield in 1982, was based on binary feature representations and binary activation functions. Since then, significant advancements have been made. Modern Hopfield networks generalize the original model to continuous states, dramatically increasing storage capacity and stability. These developments, particularly in networks with continuous dynamics and large memory capacity, have been explored in a series of works since 2016.

In this project, we focus on replicating and analyzing the 2020 paper "Hopfield Networks is All You Need", which presents a modern formulation of Hopfield networks that bridges them with attention mechanisms commonly used in deep learning nowadays.
