## Summary
The idea of this project is to implement Modern Hopfield Networks on the CIFAR10 dataset for image reconstruction of the different elements inside the set. This will be done by using TensorFlow as a way of providing another alternative than PyTorch, wich is theone used originally in [Hopfield Networks is All You Need](https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers) by [Institute for Machine Learning, Johannes Kepler University Linz](https://github.com/ml-jku).

## Dependencies
We have a Python environment newenv.yml ready for you to install
