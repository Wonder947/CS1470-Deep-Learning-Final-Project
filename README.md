# Modern Hopfield Networks on the CIFAR10 dataset
**2025 Spring CSCI1470 Deep Learning Final Project**

**Authors: [Haosheng Wang](https://github.com/Wonder947), Edrick Guerrero, [Alfonso Gordon Cabello de los Cobos](https://github.com/AlfonsoR-GordonCC)**
## Summary
The idea of this project is to implement Modern Hopfield Networks on the CIFAR10 dataset for classification of the different elements inside the set. This will be done by using TensorFlow as a way of providing another alternative than PyTorch, wich is theone used originally in [Hopfield Networks is All You Need](https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers) by [Institute for Machine Learning, Johannes Kepler University Linz](https://github.com/ml-jku)
.

## Dependencies
Runing the script/notebook requires of the following libraries and versions:

- python = 3.11.9
- tensorflow == 2.15
- matplotlib
- numpy
